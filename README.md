# CMPG323-Project4-35526734
This Repository will contail all the work needed for CMPG323 Project 4

As for this Project I have created an automation using UIPATH. This Automationis meant to automate the tedious task af adding new Devices, Zones and Categories to the ConnectedOffice Database that formed part of the API development I have done earlier.

This Project Consists of  sequences connected by a workflow. Every sequence logs into the website, populate its designated section and logs back out. By using an "Try-catch" activity an attempt was made to ensute testing of this population. The data that is used to populate the three sections ("Devices", "Categories", "Zones") are extracted from an excel workbook.

This solution is also hosted on UiPath's Orchestrator at: https://cloud.uipath.com/rsimdox/DefaultTenant/orchestrator_/processes?tid=1236578&fid=3808733&index=0&size=10&state=M4ewTgLgPgZglgUwDYBMoDsCGBbBUVxgIDGEcI6UmwxAevQCQAMUDAjFAExQDMUALAF1BQA%3D

Finally to complete this Project I used an total of 26 refrences for help that will be available in the submission.

This was a very fun Project. A bit tricky as UiPath was very new to me but I tried my best. I will continue to learn UiPath and RPA.
